# Drivy Frontend Challenge

This coding challenge comes from [Drivy](https://drivy.com/), a french company that I use and like. The engineering team at Drivy put up on Github their technical challenges (I find it so cool!) and the frontend one looked very interesting to me so I decided to do it to train for new jobs and learn new librairies or concepts I heard of but havent had the time to try out.
You can read the guidelines and what the actual challenge is over their [Github repo](https://github.com/drivy/jobs/tree/master/frontend).
